    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      If your pc is passes these criterias congrats you are eligible to go on
      one hell of a journey with kratos and his son atreus who are on a journey 
      to fulfill the dying request of her second wife  Faye that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the Nine Realms.
      This game is a cinematic masterpiece!The way the story unfolds and the detail to world design is just outstanding.
      The game packs the punch of the old game mechanics of health and and attack with a lot of variations in armour magic 
      weapon and special moves.I personally loved the little puzzles in between the journeys which are neither as hard as the puzzles 
      you might have solved in prince of persia nor as easy as assassins creed making it quite fun while keeping the game focus on 
      story and action.  </p>

    <p>
       While the first seven games were loosely based on Greek mythology,
       this episode is loosely inspired by Norse mythology, taking place several decades after God of War 
       III 2010.Six of the nine realms of Norse mythology can be explored. Predating the Vikings,most of the game takes place
       in ancient Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard, which is inhabited by humans and other creatures. It is the same realm 
       in which the Greek world exists.

    <H2>Easter eggs:</H2>
       
      <h3>Teach Atreus How To Summon Ratatoskr</h3>
      <img class="imgfull" src="img2.webp" alt="">
      <p>
       The reason this entry is considered an Easter Egg is that despite it being an ability Atreus can learn, it's hidden in a 
       very special chest that players have to go out of their way to find. The chest in question can be found at the top of the 
       Light Elf Outpost and upon opening it, players will imbue Atreus with the ability to summon the legendary Norse squirrel 
       known as Ratatoskr.Depending on what type of arrows Atreus had equipped, Ratatoskr will dig up either rage or health 
       stones in an attempt to aide the player as best as it can.
    </p>
   
  <h3>Infinity Gauntlet</h3>
  <p>
   There is fricking infinity gauntlet in this game which has 6 slots for enchantments just like the one in marvel.
   It is called Shattered Gauntlet of Ages in the game. Here is the guide
   <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Fs1TmyzdA">link</a> for your lazy ass to get the gauntlet.
  </p>

  <h3>Thor's Secret Ending</h3>
  <p>after completing the main story line there is a secret ending that you can access. If you return to the old home in the woods
     several years will seem to pass and on one fateful day a hooded man cast in lightning will appear and reveal that he's wielding
     Mjolnir, Thor's hammer!
  </p>
  <img class="imgfull" src="img4.webp" alt="">
  <h3>Atreus's real name was hidden in his home all along</h3>
